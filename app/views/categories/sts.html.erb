<h2><b><font color="black"> Project 1: Promoting Interaction and Expanding Connections in the UVA Community</font></b></h2>
<p>“How hard is the workload when taking intro Chem, STS and Multivariable? How should I be preparing for internships and making connections? Who’s the best teacher that teaches this class?” These are all questions that any incoming first-years and even upperclassmen have regarding courses and career development. Though current resources such as The Course Forum and U-Link can be helpful, on the whole, they lack the ability to offer personalized and immediate information to every student. As a result, our aim is to provide a resource that connects those with the experience and knowledge necessary to answer the questions first-years and other students have. Given how difficult the current path for a student to receive advice is, a significant amount of students end up foregoing the pursuit for answers and often repeat the mistakes of former students. Thus, the aim of our project is to develop and create an online forum that connects students with experienced members of the UVA community which will eventually improve the engineering community. </p>

<p>The mission of our website is to help connect current and prospective students with other students, alumni and faculty. The website is primarily aimed to answer questions students have about classes, majors, departments, future career planning, and any other aspect about SEAS. Our motivation behind this idea was established from our first year experiences in SEAS, and the confusions we had about scheduling. By creating a website that allows students’ questions to be answered quickly and efficiently, it will help eliminate confusion and stress about what classes to take and what professor to choose. Also, this website will allow prospective students to receive feedback from current students, professors, and alumni on issues normally not addressed by the University. An idea such as ours will improve the communication and trust between students, their peers, and their academic decisions. </p>

<p>Current solutions offered to students include the Course Forum and ULink. The Course Forum is a website that offers information about classes, professors, and scheduling. It allows you to look up any class you might want to take and can give you information, such as the grade distribution and reviews by students that have already taken the class. However, the website is more geared towards ratings rather than actually answering specific questions that students may have. ULink is a peer advising organization that connects incoming first years with older students, providing a mentor that they can go to for advice. However, this creates a more formal environment, and first years may not be comfortable asking more personal questions. Because of this, our website will be different from any current solution, and will have a far wider reach. Through this website we hope to help students, staff, and faculty of the SEAS community by allowing them to answer each other’s questions in a fast, easy, and efficient manner. This is something that has not been an option before, and will help members of the SEAS community now and for years to come. </p>

<p>Although we hope that one day this project will serve as the primary resource that students use to answer their questions, our goal for the semester is to construct a prototype with a few student, alumni, and professor users and gauge what improvements they would prefer in the next prototype. We expect to have all SEAS classes listed on the website by the end of the semester and hopefully, expand to other schools later on in development. To expedite the process, we plan on contacting professors and SEAS faculty to serve as mentors who can give us advice. We will also get in touch with the first year committee to determine what features the first-years would like to see in our forum, as this website is mainly tailored to them.  </p>

<p>The first step of our project is to prove that there is need for this forum. To do this, we plan on distributing tailored surveys to students, professors, and alumni. We plan to reach students by asking professors to distribute surveys during classes and tabling near dining halls. We will survey alumni by asking the alumni association to distribute the survey to their alumni network. These surveys will ask professors and alumni if they are willing to answer questions on the forum and ask students if they would use the forum to ask their questions. We expect most students, particularly the underclassmen, to be interested in using this website for their questions. The challenge is in getting upperclassmen, professors, and alumni to answer questions that they see, as they don’t have a large incentive to answer questions. Throughout the surveying period, we will concurrently begin building the website. The goal would be to have base functionality to serve all types of users and have the organization necessary to address core questions. Once the website is built, we will have a trial period where we pick users from those we have surveyed to review the website and detail what changes they would prefer.</p>

<h2><b><font color="black"> Project 2: Enhancing ENGR 1620 and 1621</font></b></h2>
<p>While 75% of new U.Va. SEAS graduates report full-time employment lined up, and 16% plan to go on to graduate school, after four years of an undergraduate engineering curriculum, what can be said of the remaining 9%? In addition, according to research from spring 2016, there is a direct correlation between student satisfaction with the introductory engineering course, ENGR 1620, and the number of guests representative of the various majors who are invited to speak. Both of these facts have inspired our team to develop and propose several small changes to the ENGR 1620 and 1621 curricula in order to improve the satisfaction of SEAS engineers, whether they are on Grounds or alumni.</p>
<p>Our group project will transform SEAS using a multipronged approach that addresses issues regarding employment and the major decision process. We hope to fine-tune the dynamic between SEAS students and faculty so that it is more resonant with the interests of both groups. Through the ENGR 1620 and ENGR 1621 courses, we hope to give the SEAS student population an improved set of professional skills and a more focused mindset that will remain with them throughout the rest of their academic pursuits. Concurrently, the SEAS faculty will be more productive in delivering lessons and simulating a real world environment in class. While remaining unique and upholding its distinctive culture, SEAS will become more effective in meeting the needs of students who live in a world with an increasingly competitive job market. SEAS will enhance its identity of serving as a strong stepping stone for incoming students who want to help make a real difference in the broader engineering country as an adult. </p>
<p>In addition to aiding with employment, we will use ENGR 1620 and ENGR 1621 as a medium of helping students select the best major for their respective interests and career goals. We will attempt to expose students to the different majors with greater breadth and depth. As a result, students will live out in the classroom a more diverse selection of projects to help better discover their own identity as an engineer in a technology driven world. The difference this project makes will be engrained culturally in SEAS, allowing longer lasting results that will enhance the brand of SEAS.
Our vision is to ensure that First Years can make informed decisions about their choice of major and, through introductory engineering courses, acquire programming and software skills and knowledge that will prepare them for an internship after only their first year. </p>

<h2><b><font color="black"> Project 3: Diversity Awareness in SEAS</font></b></h2>
<p> 
Earlier this month, a faculty member in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the University of Virginia posted a comment on Facebook comparing Black Lives Matter to the KKK.  The University responded by allowing the professor to take some time away from the classroom and releasing a public statement about their stance against this behavior.  They stated that the University did not “condone actions that undermine our values, dedication to diversity, and educational mission” and followed up by saying that “the incident has illuminated the need for further dialogue.”  In response to this episode, our group has decided to research the diversity statistics in the School of Engineering and gather data about students’ responses to this.  We hope to open conversation about the issue because we believe that the comfort level of current minority students in SEAS is vital to the continuation of increasing diversity at our school. </p>
<p>
Our mission is to raise awareness of gender and racial inequality among students and faculty in SEAS.  Of the SEAS student body, only a third of the population is female and less than 4% of students are black.  In order to address the implicit biases associated with minorities in SEAS, we are aiming to create and sustain a dialogue between students and faculty to address how gender and racial bias affect students and faculty.  It is important to open the dialogue and make educators more comfortable with discussing inequality with all students in order to create awareness within SEAS.  Department heads and deans, who are typically white males, can use their position at the University to open and sustain this dialogue (Abdul-Raheem, 2016).  By partnering with faculty in SEAS, we hope to create a more welcoming atmosphere for discussion on inequality and bias, and raise support to diminish their presence in our community.
Diversity dialogues, such as PULSE and Sustained Dialogues, have been common in efforts to address the biases against minorities.  Quantitatively, it was found that students participating in diversity dialogues experienced greater commonality and less divisiveness between each other (Engberg, 2004).  These programs invite students and faculty to participate in productive conversations, and to get a better understanding of the issues others may face.  In conclusion, we can utilize resources in the faculty to raise support for opening the discussion of biases and inequality present in SEAS, and sustain these discussion to create a more inclusive learning atmosphere. </p>
<p> Research/Action Plans </p>
<li> Our vision is to raise awareness on the racial and gender inequality that exists in SEAS in hopes of bringing about change. Furthermore, we also hope our efforts help to combat implicit biases.
<li> We plan on contacting the Center for Diversity in Engineering (CDE) and obtain their data on racial and gender diversity within the Engineering School.
<li> We have reached out to Dean Gates to schedule a meeting to discuss our project.
<li> We already have a mentor, Dr. Williams, who has helped us with our student survey. Dr. Williams works at the CDE.
<li> We are engaging in conversations about diversity with various faculty and consolidating their responses. We plan on using these conversations to get a gauge on how faculty members feel about diversity in SEAS and how the school is working towards encouraging and supporting diversity.
<li> SEAS is recognized at UVA and beyond as a leader in education and innovation.  For this reason we expect SEAS to be responsive to the current issues of diversity and inclusion impacting our local, national and global community.  In order to better understand and support members of the SEAS community, we need to study the experiences among its diverse members.
<li> We have created a student-faculty forum to be held on November 3rd from 5:30 – 7pm in MEC 339 in which the attendees will engage in conversations about diversity.
<li>We have created a 5-10 minute brief survey for the purposes of collecting data to further understand and support our community. This survey is to be sent out to students.
<li>We are working on a post-forum survey for the faculty to gauge how they felt about the conversation.
<li> After the student-faculty forum, we plan on drafting another event to discuss gender biases. For this task, we plan on reaching out to Dr. Feltaut as a possible mentor. Dr. Feltaut is the Project Manager of the CHARGE program at UVA.
<li> In the long run, we want to make these events a series of monthly discussions with different topics in order to raise awareness for multiple types of biases. Some examples of other possible discussion topics include gender and other racial groups. We want to initiate conversations on these topics in hopes of reversing implicit biases.</p>

<h2><b><font color="black"> Project 4: OverSEAS </font></b></h2>
<p>
Many college students look forward to studying abroad sometime during their undergraduate career, as it is a hailed way not only to learn curriculum, but also to expand upon personal skills and cultural appreciations. For engineers at our University, however, finding the time to study abroad can be near impossible due to some of the University-specific courses that are difficult to find abroad. During the 2011-2012 school year, only 8.5% of all UVA students who studied abroad were engineering majors, and only one-fifth of SEAS students studied abroad, whereas over one-third of the CLAS studied abroad (Education Abroad at the University of Virginia).  It is important for the engineering school to be cooperative and flexible when it comes to study abroad so that this deficit between SEAS and CLAS can be reconciled. There are many studies attesting to the benefits of a semester in a foreign country, and our students desperately want more opportunities to travel and to receive the benefits that come with these opportunities.  
All members of this group desire to study abroad but have found it difficult to pick classes and plan when to go. Our end-goal is to make it simple for engineers to go abroad through UVA and to make costs and classes clear to the applicants.</p>
<p>
Allowing all majors a chance to easily study abroad for a semester will broaden the worldview of many SEAS students and expand many points of view regarding other cultures. Improving the diversity experienced by all members of SEAS will aid in future endeavors as many projects are not limited to the United States, and many ask project members to reach outside of their comfort zones and experience a completely new country and culture. Having these experiences early on in a career allows for increased flexibility later on and an enhanced understanding of the world as a whole, which is integral to being productive leaders of the world and creating projects which benefit all. Having SEAS established not just in Charlottesville, but across the whole entire world, will increase the University’s reputation and allow for different opportunities for both students and employees.
SEAS does have resources available to students who want to go abroad. They currently offer semester-long programs as well as shorter summer and winter sessions through UVA and third party providers, though most are through these third parties, not UVA. Our issue is not with the simple availability of abroad programs but with the inability of the programs offered to adapt to the four-year plans of different majors. SEAS students who want to go abroad should be able to go easily through the University and should not be limited by their major.</p>
<p>
Our vision for our OverSEAS project includes improving the accessibility of semester-long study abroad programs for engineering students and creating a proposal for bringing specific UVA courses abroad via online courses.  In combining these two visions, we aim to make study abroad simple, accessible and eventually the norm for UVA engineering students.</p>
<p>
Mentors we plan on contacting, include but are not limited to: </p>
<p>
<li>Reid Bailey	Systems Engineering	</li>
<li>James Groves	Online Classes </li>
<li>Josh Choi	Chemical Engineering </li> 
<li>om Horton	Computer Science </li>
<li>Maya Drake	International Advisor </li>	 
<li>Richard Miksad	Civil/Environmental </li>
<li>Dana Elzey	MSE/Engineering Society </li>
<li>Michael Shirts	Chemical Engineering </li>
<li>William Guilford	BME/Online Curriculum </li>	 
<li>Mircea Stan	Electrical/Computer </li>
<li>Jack Thaker	Mechanical/Aerospace </li>
</p>
<p>
A majority of these points of contact are the study abroad advisors for their respective areas.
We plan to contact the advisors for each major and discuss with them the best semester to go abroad and the courses that would need to be taken. We plan to discuss with James Groves and William Guilford about the feasibility of implementing specific UVA classes abroad via online classes. After our discussions, we plan to create a comprehensive summary of the semesters and courses for each major which would allow SEAS students the best opportunity to study abroad. In the end, we hope to submit our proposal to the University.

<h2><b><font color="black"> Project 5: Promoting Health and Wellness </font></b></h2>
<p>
A study conducted by Northwestern University found that approximately 95% of college students do not get the suggested quantity of fruits and vegetables per day. Additionally, more than 60% of students get less than the weekly recommended exercise (Spain). College students are known for their habits of unhealthy eating, infrequent exercise, and frequent binge drinking. This culture not only degrades physical health, but creates a culture where mental health is pushed aside. Universities need a change in culture that originates within the student community in order to improve the college lifestyle to better support health. We intend to initiate this change by taking action in three areas of the university community.
</p>
<p>
Our group plans to promote health and wellness in SEAS culture by offering healthy meal swipe options at the Castle and Crossroads, partnering with the Health and Wellness committee in ESC to offer a healthy banquet to raise awareness of eating healthy, and by approving 1-credit fitness classes in the Kinesiology department as unrestricted electives for engineering students.
</p>
<p>
As was shown in the Northwestern study, the culture of unhealthiness is pervasive at all U.S. universities. Very few students get the recommended daily amounts of healthy foods and exercise. This atmosphere is even more prevalent in UVA SEAS, where in addition to the unhealthy culture of college in general, students are pressured to “work until you drop,” taking few breaks to get exercise and working through meals.
</p>
<p>
To this point in time, health and wellness has only been addressed with regard to individuals, and not much effort has been put into creating a unified force to promote change within the engineering school. The Health and Wellness Committee, a branch of the Engineering Student Council, has recently been created to provide information and outlets through which students can maintain health and wellness. It has arranged a sustained dialogue and a yoga night, which students can participate in to promote their wellbeing. Fitness classes are offered through the kinesiology program, in which students can enroll in a simple one credit class, focusing on physical activity and learning about the activity. These classes are excellent at promoting physical fitness, but there is still expansion that can be done on the program to allow for more participation in these beneficial classes.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to change the culture of the Engineering school to promote long term health and happiness to all students and faculty. Through smaller events and initiatives, we hope to spark discussions about health and wellness. These goals can also be achieved by contacting those who are already dedicated to furthering health in SEAS. Our first contact is Kyle Neuner, SEAS student and committee director for the Health and Wellness committee. We also plan to contact Lloyd Harriott, the Association Dean for Undergraduate Education in order to approve one credit kinesiology classes as unrestricted electives. Finally, we plan to contact Brett Curtis, a UVA dining educator to provide us with resources to change late night meal swipe options.
